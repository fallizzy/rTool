This is a Steam-related DLL file. I won't explain it in detail, but that's what it does. If your Steam folder doesn't have hid.dll, the games you add to Steam will appear as purchased. That's basically what it does. Actually, this hid. dll file—I didn't create it; it's just something that comes with Steam Tools. If it's not there, it's meaningless. I'm just new to this; I don't have that advanced knowledge. I did it with AI; it took me a day. I don't know if it's good or bad, but I did it, and I think it turned out well.
